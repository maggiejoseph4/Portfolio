    Hey, I'm Maggie. I grew up on Long Island and am a rising junior. I started coding sophomore year of 
  <br>
  high school where I learned Java. My other hobbies include, photography (click on photos at the top to see),
  <br>
  and I play soccer. Two fun facts about me is that I've been a vegetarian for five years and I have traveled to eight countries.
