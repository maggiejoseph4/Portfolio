    Hey, I'm Maggie. I grew up on Long Island and am a rising junior. I started coding sophomore year of 
  <br>
  high school where I learned Java. My other hobbies include, photography (click on photos at the top to see),
  <br>
  and I play soccer. Two fun facts about me is that I've been a vegetarian for five years and I have traveled to eight countries.

  1. Python is more elaborate than scarcth but they both have fucntions and loops ect. 
  <br>
  Python is easier because if you have a problem you can write it but in scratch you have to find it 
  <br>
  2. What I like was after debugging my program I understood the purpose of things. It was ffrustrating at first but then
  <br>
  I started t get it and am now comfortable using functions efficiently.
