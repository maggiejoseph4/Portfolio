    Hey, I'm Maggie. I grew up on Long Island and am a rising junior. I started coding sophomore year of 
  high school where we learned Java. My other hobbies include, photography (click on photos at the top to see), 
  and I play soccer. A fun fact about me is that I've been a vegetarian for five years and I have traveled to eight countries.
